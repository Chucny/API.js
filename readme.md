I'm planning to give it more functions, but for now, the functions are:<br>website_get_contents(url) A way to fetch the source code from a website<br>GetTitleAndDescription(url) A way to get the description and title from a website. Output: [url, title, description]<br>api_get_contents, Just the same as fetch(), ignore it<br>get_weather(city) this function gets the weather from a city (actually, the temperature)<br>get_ip_ipv4() A way to get your IP address.</p><br><big style="color:grey;font-size:16px;">Copyright  &#169; 2024 Chucny Licensed Under Apache License 2.0</big></body></html>
